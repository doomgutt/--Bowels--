### Speed
#### Speed improvements
- Try using Numba from the beginning. Perhaps even Cuda?
#### Should implement "game speed" measurer?

- Not sure if it's a good idea to turn everything into objects yet.
    - I suppose the game only slows down once you start changing all their bits?
    - not sure....


### Utility
