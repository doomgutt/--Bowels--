# --Bowels--
A biopunk game with a focus on autonomy study


## Installing requirements
I'm using Conda to set up an environment. There are ways to do it differently but I cba to deal with unless this project takes off.

### The process
- Create and activate new conda environment:
    - `conda create -n bowels python=3.10.4`
    - `conda activate bowels`
- If you messed up you can delete it and start again:
    - `conda deactivate`
    - `conda env remove -n bowels`
- Then use pip to install necessary modules
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
