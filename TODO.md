## Coming up:

## Thoughts
### Speed
#### Speed improvements
- Try using Numba from the beginning. Perhaps even Cuda?
#### Should implement "game speed" measurer?

### Aesthetics


### Design
#### Continuous movement
- instead of doing grid-movement, maybe do continuous movement, but render it on a grid...? probably not?

#### "Tile" objects
- Not sure if it's a good idea to turn everything into objects yet.
    - I suppose the game only slows down once you start changing all their bits?
    - not sure....


### Utility


# Thought dump
- Try moving shapes instead of re-drawing them??
