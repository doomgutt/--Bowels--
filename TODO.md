# Stuff I should do/consider doing


## Speed
Try using Numba from the beginning. Perhaps even Cuda?


## Aesthetics
### Draw square random noise
it makes the noise every time a square is drawn. Need to be every time an object is made...


Remake board with TILE objects?


## Design
### Continuous movement
- instead of doing grid-movement, maybe do continuous movement, but render it on a grid...? probably not?
