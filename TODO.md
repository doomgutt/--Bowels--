# Stuff I should do/consider doing


## Speed
### Speed improvements
- Try using Numba from the beginning. Perhaps even Cuda?
### Should implement "game speed" measurer?

## Aesthetics


## Design
### Continuous movement
- instead of doing grid-movement, maybe do continuous movement, but render it on a grid...? probably not?

### "Tile" objects
- Not sure if it's a good idea to turn everything into objects yet.
    - I suppose the game only slows down once you start changing all their bits?
    - not sure....


## Utility

# Coming up:
- implement controls
